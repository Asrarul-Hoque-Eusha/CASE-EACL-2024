# Shared task on Hate Speech and Stance Detection during Climate Activism [CASE 2024 at EACL 2024]

We have participated in the shared task on **Climate Activism Stance and Hate Event Detection Shared Task at CASE@EACL2024** in the CASE 2024 Competition and obtained remarkable positions (1st, 5th and 13th) in the 3 subtasks of this task. The full task description is given below:

Hate speech detection and stance detection are some of the most important aspects of event identification during climate change activism events. In the case of hate speech detection, the event is the occurrence of hate speech, the entity is the target of the hate speech, and the relationship is the connection between the two. The hate speech event has targets to which hate is directed. Identification of targets is an important task within hate speech event detection. Additionally, stance event detection is an important part of assessing the dynamics of protests and activisms for climate change. This helps to understand whether the activist movements and protests are being supported or opposed. This task will have three subtasks (i) Hate speech identification (ii) Targets of Hate Speech Identification (iii) Stance Detection.

 

### Sub-task A: Hate Speech Detection

The goal of this task is to identify whether the given text contains hate speech or not. The text, which are the dataset for this subtask, will have annotations for the prevalence of hate speech.

### Sub-task B: Target Detection
